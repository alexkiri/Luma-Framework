// UpscaleImagePS
// LUMA FT: this only runs when upscaling the image from a lower resolution (dynamic resolution scaling DRS), and it runs after all AA and "PostAAComposites".
// It would be possible to directly replace this pass with DLSS SR, but we'd then be forced to run DLSS after AA (if not forced disabled), Film Grain, vignette, etc etc which isn't ideal.
//
// DRS works by drawing to a dynamically sized top left portion of all textures (almost all of them are drawn like that).
// To achieve that, CryEngine uses a smaller DX viewport (and custom vertices?), matching the rendering resolution area;
// so vertex shaders output a position (e.g. for 1920x1080 with DRS at 0.75x, it would be from 0x0 to 1279x719) and UV texture coordinates from 0 to 1 (with 1 mapping to the edge of the rendering resolution area, not the full resolution area).
// A total of (e.g.) 1280x720 texels will then draw/write on the target texture, with the pixel shader having UVs in the 0-1 range from the source color (TEXCOORD0), which will then need scaling to sample from any other texture, as they were also 
// only drawn in their top left part (most textures).
// In other words, MapViewportToRaster() was taking the UV and scaling it by "CV_HPosScale.xy",
// (yes, UVs can scaled like that between texture sizes, by just multiplying them).
//
// This uses "FullscreenTriVS".
