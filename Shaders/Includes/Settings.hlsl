// Whether we store the post process buffers in linear space scRGB or gamma space (sRGB under normal circumstances) (like in the vanilla game, though now we use FP16 textures as opposed to UNORM8 ones).
// Note that converting between linear and gamma space back and forth results in quality loss, especially over very high and very low values, so this is best left on.
// 0 Gamma space:
//   vanilla like (including UI, depending on "UI_DRAW_TYPE"), but on float/linear buffers
//   this has as tiny loss of quality due to storing sRGB gamma space on linear buffers
//   gamma correction happens at the end, in the linearization pass
//   colors are stored with the same white level (paper white) of SDR, with 1 being the SDR peak white
// 1 Linear space:
//   UI might look slightly different from vanilla (in alpha blends) (depending on "UI_DRAW_TYPE")
//   gamma correction happens early, in tonemapping, or at the end (depending on "EARLY_DISPLAY_ENCODING")
//   colors are stored with the same white level (paper white) of SDR, with 1 being the SDR peak white, or in dynamic paper white range (also depending on "EARLY_DISPLAY_ENCODING")
// 2 Linear space until UI, then gamma space:
//   more specifically, linear until the last pass that always runs before UI (e.g. "PostAAComposites" for "Prey"),
//   this has the some of the advantage of both linear and gamma methods, and UI looks like vanilla out of the box
//   gamma correction happens at the end, in the linearization pass
//   (to avoid a billion different formulas around the code and to make gamma blends look like vanilla,
//    if we corrected in the tonemap/grading shader, then we'd need to use sRGB gamma in the end,
//    also we wouldn't know whether to correct the 0-1 range of the whole range)
//   ideally we would have gamma corrected before HDR tonemapping, but the complexity cost is too big for the small visual gains

// As many games, Prey rendered and tonemapped in linear space, though applied the sRGB gamma transfer function to apply the color grading LUT.
// Almost all TVs follow gamma 2.2 and most monitors also do, so to maintain the SDR look (and near black level), we need to linearize with gamma 2.2 and not sRGB (1).
// Disabling this will linearize with gamma sRGB, ignoring that the game would have been developed on (and for) gamma 2.2 displays (<=0).
// If you want something in between, thus keeping the sRGB color hue (channels ratio) but with the gamma 2.2 corrected luminance, set this to a higher value (>=2).
// Note that if "POST_PROCESS_SPACE_TYPE" is 0, this simply determines how gamma is linearized for intermediary operations,
// while everything stays in sRGB gamma (as theoretically it would have been originally, even if it was displayed on 2.2) when stored in textures,
// so this determines how the final shader should linearize (if >=1, from 2.2, if <=0, from sRGB, thus causing raised blacks compared to how the gamma would have appeared on gamma 2.2 displays).
// Note that by gamma correction we mean fixing up the game's bad gamma implementation, though sometimes this term is used to imply "display encoding".
// We do not have a gamma 2.4 setting, because the game was seemingly not meant for that. It'd be easily possible to add one if ever needed (e.g. replace the "DefaultGamma" value, or directly expose that to the user (don't!)).

// If se set this to 0, we'd also need to pre-acknowledge the later peak shift when tonemapping to the display. Plus, pow changes direction around 1, so doing that would contribute to creating a less contiguous curve.
