// Tonemapping by luminance, is generally more perception accurate but can then generate rgb colors "out of range". This setting fixes them up,
// though it's optional as it's working based on assumptions on how current displays work, which might not be true anymore in the future.

// and restores the chrominance of that on the luminance tonemap, this simultaneously avoids hue shifts,
// while keeping a nice highlights rolloff (desaturation), that looks natural.
// The correction is still useful to avoid hue shifts from channels that go outside the display range.
